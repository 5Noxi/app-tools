# Thorium Tool

Thorium has already many files removed & settings applied, this tool will remove the last few files, which aren't needed for browsing.

| Option        | Description|
| ------------- | ---------- |
| **Installer** | - Redirects you to [Thorium-Win/releases](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-Win/releases), as it doesn't have a permanent download link.|
| **Debloat**   | - Removes error reporting related files (error reporting related files)<br> - Removes notification helper<br> - Removes language files (only leaves en-US)<br> - Removes installer leftovers, logs<br> - Removes Thorium Shell (more info [here](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/thorium_shell/README.md))<br> - Removes packaging tools<br> - Removes Thorium icons/images, may break some icons (not for me)<br> - Removes Chromedriver<br>    - "ChromeDriver is a separate executable that Selenium WebDriver uses to control Chrome" ~ [info](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/get-started)<br> - Removes `thor_ver` (Removing `thor_ver` may break [winupdater](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium-winupdater)? - Winupdater is discontinued, so the file can be removed safely [[*](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/711e1cfc42116dc38920fdb132ba765cd332ccb2/src/chrome/installer/mini_installer/chrome.release#L13)]) |

# Flags - Privacy, Security & Performance

You could also add command lines, instead of applying some of them via `chrome://flags`, but you won't see the changes if the command line is also available in `chrome://flags`. Verify them by entering `chrome://version` and looking into the '**Command Line**' section, you should see all commands, which are currently used there. Command flags can be found [here](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/docs/CMDLINE_FLAGS_LIST.md).

More CLI flags (add them to the shortcut):

Thorium already has a lot of flags applied by default - the current ones are listed [here](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/docs/PATCHES.md). You want to know more about thorium, e.g. how to build it yourself?
> https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/tree/main/docs

The following are flags, which can be changed, by opening `chrome://flags` and pasting the name into the search bar. Some are personal preference, some may disable features, which you want, so read the desc of the flag, before changing it. (I collected them with brave, so some may not exist in thorium)

## Experimental Flags

The following are flags, which also can be useful, but youll have to test them yourself. Make sure to read the desc of the flag! If you experience issues, revert them to their default value. Using the flags listed above is already enough, this is just for people, who want to test more. If you dont know much about such settings, leave them, as for example `enable-waitable-swap-chain` can cause frame drops, if changing it to max 1 frame.
