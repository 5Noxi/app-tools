# Ungoogled Chromium Tool

It only debloats the installation a bit, for proper setup use the info below. Optionally you can use the debloater/clean up. Personal recommendation: switch to [Thorium](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-Win/releases)/[Brave](https://brave.com/download/).

| Option        | Description                                                                                                                                         |

#  Flags - Privacy, Security & Performance

You could also add command lines, instead of applying some of them via `chrome://flags`, but you won't see the changes if the command line is also available in `chrome://flags`. Verify them by entering `chrome://version` and looking into the '**Command Line**' section, you should see all commands, which are currently used there. You can find a list of flags [here](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium/blob/master/docs/flags.md). 

The following are flags, which can be changed, by opening `chrome://flags` and pasting the name into the search bar. Some are personal preference, some may disable features, which you want, so read the desc of the flag before changing it.

## Exmperimental Flags

The following are flags, which also can be useful, but youll have to test them yourself. Make sure to read the desc of the flag! If you experience issues, revert them to their default value. Using the flags listed above is already enough, this is just for people, who want to test more. If you dont know much about such settings, leave them, as for example `enable-waitable-swap-chain` can cause frame drops, if changing it to max 1 frame.
