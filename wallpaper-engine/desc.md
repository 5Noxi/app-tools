# Wallpaper Engine Debloat

There's no actual use case for it, I created it for whatever reason.

| Option      | Description                                                                                                                  |

| **Debloat** | It's kind of useless since Steam redownloads most of them on startup.<br>- Removes language packs, backups, logs, and more |

# In-App Settings

Quality settings are personal preferences, as WE won't run anyway if not focused.
